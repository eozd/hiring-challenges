# Conversation Frontend Challenge

## Intro

This challenge is about showing us that you are a developer with a fast perception and excellent analytic skills but also that you are able to dive into and leverage modern web technologies to create an awesome user experience.

We want you to build a conversation interface prototype with a frontend framework of your choice that allows an user to navigate through different conversations and reply to them:

1. Show a list of existing conversations
2. When the user selects a conversation then list all messages for this conversation
3. When the user replies in a conversation then her message and the coresponding response should be added to the conversation

You do not necessarily need to implement all features. Watch your time and try to get as far as possible in about 5-8 hours of development.

## Step 1

* Become familier with the [Conversation Echo API](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tamediadigital/hiring-challenges/master/conversation-frontend-challenge/api.yaml)
* Build a modern web app with the Conversation Echo API

## Step 2

* Create a Dockerfile that allows other developers to run the application in a Docker Container


# Evaluation criterias

What we look for:

* Clean project setup and documentation
* Ability to dive into a new topic, extract the important points and then implement it
* Polish and an eye for design: focus on making it look good instead of adding features
* Make it snappy
* Display the important data at the right place without overloading.
* Strip away features, time is scarce!
* Document your approach, your decisions and your general notes
